# what is computer language 
 - A language is a mediuam to interact with computer 
 - A language is iused to solve a problem by giving some solution (writing a program)

# types 
 - Machine language:
        the code written in 0s and 1s can be directly executed  by CPU
 - Assembly Language:
        it is better than machine level language and it will increase ease of wrting 
 - Programming Language:
    - General purpose language:
         a programming language that is broadly applicable over complex application.
                E.g : C, C++, Java, Python etc 
    - Markup Language:
               can write document in away that is very similar to text
               E.g: HTML, xhtml, xml
    - Stylesheet Language:
                a computer language that express the presentation of  structured document.
                E.g: css, Sass,  etc 
    - Query Language:
                it is used to query in database.
                E.g : SQL, MysQL 
    - Scripting Language:
                a language used to write simple to complex script.
                E.g : JavScript, Python, shell, VB, etc.   


# Compiled language
    A programming language which involves an execuatable to execyte the login instead of executing file or a source direclty
    eg. C, C++, etc..

    - pre-processing
    - compiling 
    - Assembling
    - Linking 

# Interpreted language
    Language mostly executes the source code directly and freely, without previously compiling programm
    into executable
    e.g : Python, JavaSrcipt, BASH, BASIC etc



# High level language vs Low level language

        High level language                           Low level language
        -programmer friendly                          -machine friendly
        -easy to uderstand                            - tough to understand
        -it is simple debug                           - it is very complex 
        - it portable                                 - it can't be portable
        - it needs compiler or interpreter            - it needs assembler 
           for translation
